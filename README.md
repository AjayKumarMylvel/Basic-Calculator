# 🧮 Basic Calculator Project

A basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates fundamental front-end development concepts, including event handling, dynamic input validation, and basic arithmetic operations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division ➗
- **Clear and Delete Options**: Reset the calculator (AC) or remove the last entered value (DE) 🔄
- **Decimal Handling**: Prevents multiple decimal points in the same number 🔢
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices 📱💻
- **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA labels for better accessibility ♿️

## 🎥 Demo

- Check out the demo video below to see how the calculator works in action!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the layout and UI of the calculator 📝
- **CSS**: Styling the calculator interface and ensuring responsiveness 🎨
- **JavaScript**: Handling user inputs, arithmetic operations, and error management ⚡

## 💡 Usage

- Click on the buttons to perform arithmetic operations ➕➖✖️➗.
- The "AC" button clears the screen, and "DE" deletes the last entry ❌.
- The "=" button evaluates the entered expression and displays the result ✅.
  
## ⚡ Challenges Faced

- Decimal Input Handling: Ensuring only one decimal point per number was tricky but solved by dynamically checking the input 🔍.
- Error Handling: Dealing with invalid expressions (like ending with operators) and ensuring the calculator doesn’t crash 🚨.
- Responsive Layout: Designing the interface to look good and be usable on both large screens and mobile devices 📱💻.
  
## 📚 What I Learned

- Self-Taught via YouTube and ChatGPT: I built this project through self-learning by watching tutorials on YouTube and using ChatGPT for guidance and troubleshooting 🤓
- How to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple but functional web application 💻.
- Techniques for input validation and dynamic updates to the user interface 🔄.
- Best practices for making websites accessible and responsive 🌐.
  
## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, exponentiation) 🔢.
- Improve the error handling and UI feedback (e.g., displaying an error message instead of "Error") ⚙️.
